# Hello World

## Purpose

To practice git usage with github classroom.

## Directions
The first step of this assignment is to accept the invite link, which since you are reading this you have likely already done. 
Once you have done that, you'll have a personal copy of the lab template that you will fill in with your own code. Every time 
you make changes to some of the files and commit them to this repository, and automatic grader will be run on them, providing 
feedback. Feedback can be viewed by clicking on the little x or check-mark icon by the most recent commit message.

Your goal is to fix the errors in the provided code and make your code output `Hello World!`.
